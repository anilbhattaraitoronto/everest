The Everest Magazine App will have the following Features

1. On the Front End

-Responsive, mobile first design based on site theme colors;
-user registration and login option for readers to comment on posts;
-admin login for staff;

2. Administration Interface
Admin Staff, once authenticated through front-end login, can do the following:
-Create different posts(e.g., news items, opinion items, event posts, and advertisement);
-Edit those posts;
-Delete those posts;
-Delete registered users

Admin Staff CANNOT DO the following:
-see users' password. it will be highly encrypted.
-as said above, however, admin can remove users by deleting them if needed. 

3. App documentation for Admin Staff
-Documentation will tackle basic operational issues in managing the apps. I will also provide source code, either through github, or file transfer, to designated person. If Needed, I can explain some part of the codes if admin staff need it.
-Basic operational issues include:
-how to add, edit, delete posts/users. These tasks will be easy with Django framework that I will be using in building the website. But I will provide detailed documentation of the step-by-step process involved in these tasks. 

4. Occassional maintenance
-I will be available for maintenance if necessary, but I will do full testing and therefore, barring major hacking incident in the host server, the disruptions should be minimal;
-Based on the need, we can also scale up different aspects of the site.

Please let me know if you would like further clarification or want to add features. 

Thank you and I am quite excited to design and build this website from the ground up;
:-)
